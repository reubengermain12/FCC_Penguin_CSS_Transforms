CSS TRANSFORMS - PENGUIN

I can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw my reader's eye. I can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this course, I will build a penguin. I'll use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of my penguin, create a background, and animate my work.
